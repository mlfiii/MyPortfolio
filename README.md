Design
Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

Mobile-first design

Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
